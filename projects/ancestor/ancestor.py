    Goal:
    Write a function that, given the dataset and 
    the ID of an individual in the dataset, returns 
    their earliest known ancestor â€“ the one at the 
    farthest distance from the input individual.

    Conditions:
    If there is more than one ancestor tied 
    for "earliest", return the one with the 
    lowest numeric ID. If the input individual 
    has no parents, the function should return -1.

    1. Describe the problem
    - find earliest known ancestor, the one furthest from input individual
    - this is a DFS(Depth First Search problem)

    2. Build graph or write getNeighbors function
