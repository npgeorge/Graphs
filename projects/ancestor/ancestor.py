    Goal:
    Write a function that, given the dataset and 
    the ID of an individual in the dataset, returns 
    their earliest known ancestor â€“ the one at the 
    farthest distance from the input individual.

    Conditions:
    If there is more than one ancestor tied 
    for "earliest", return the one with the 
    lowest numeric ID. If the input individual 
    has no parents, the function should return -1.

    1. Describe the problem in graphs terms
    - What are our nodes?
    - What are our edges? aka when are two nodes connected?

    -- Is this a directed or undirected graph? Cyclic or acyclic?


    - find earliest known ancestor, the one furthest from input individual
    - this is a DFS(Depth First Search problem)

    DAG: directed acyclic graph, from parent to child or from child to parent

    2. Build graph or write getNeighbors function

    3. Choose your fighter / which algorithm to use
